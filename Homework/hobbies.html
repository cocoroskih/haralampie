  <h1>Hobbies</h1>
  <p>
    Sports have always played a big role in my life. I’ve been playing basketball for nine years and had the incredible honor of captaining my school team to win the national championship in 2024. One of my favorite memories is lifting the trophy with my teammates after all the hard work and dedication. I am also part of a 6-a-side football team with my friends, where I take the lead as the coach—selecting players, planning tactics, and creating strategies to help us win.
<br/>
    I’m a big fan of tennis, especially Roger Federer. One unforgettable moment for me was the Wimbledon final against Novak Djokovic—a marathon match that showed true sportsmanship and passion, even though Federer didn’t win. Football is another passion of mine, and I’m a devoted AC Milan supporter, standing by the team through thick and thin.
<br/>
    Outside of sports, I love movies, especially art-house and slow-paced dramas that capture the essence of cinema as the seventh art. Music is also a big part of my life; I don’t limit myself to any specific genre and enjoy a wide variety depending on my mood.
