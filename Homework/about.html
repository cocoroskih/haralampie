        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I’m Haralampie Cocoroski, a first-year Computer Science student at FINKI. I chose this field because I’m curious about how technology works and believe it offers excellent opportunities for the future. My main areas of interest are artificial intelligence and game development, and I’m eager to learn as much as possible in these fields.
<br/>
            So far, I’ve been developing my programming skills primarily in C++, which has been both challenging and rewarding. Outside of coding, I enjoy playing video games—mainly strategy and puzzle genres—and I actively follow a variety of sports, including football, basketball, and Formula 1.
<br/>
            Music plays an important role in my life, as it helps me stay focused and motivated. I consider myself to be somewhere between an introvert and extrovert; I appreciate spending time with friends as well as enjoying quiet moments for reflection.
<br/>
            Although I don’t travel often yet, I look forward to exploring new places in the future. This webpage provides an opportunity to share a bit about myself, my interests, and my goals as I continue to grow both personally and academically.</p>
